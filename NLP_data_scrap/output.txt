Article Heading: India to flag climate finance gap at COP27
Article Text:
SHARM EL-SHEIKH, EGYPT : The annual UN climate change conference will begin here on Sunday in the backdrop of the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war and the three scary reports that in the past 10 days noted how the combined pledge for action by over 190 countries is not enough to save the world from the disastrous consequences of global warming.While two reports from the United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) highlighted huge gap in existing climate action of countries, the third one by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) flagged that the atmospheric levels of the three main greenhouse gases ( GHG ) - carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide - reached new record highs in 2021. It means the earth will continue to warm due to these heat-trapping gases.Representatives of over 190 countries including many heads of government, ministers and senior officials will in the next 12 days brainstorm over these gaps in order to look for solutions at the COP27 which is being taken up as a ‘COP for action’ on all those promises made in the past - be it on finance, mitigation (emission cut) or adaptation.India will be represented at the 27th session of the UN climate conference (COP27) by the country’s environment minister Bhupender Yadav who is leading a team of officials and experts from different ministries.The country will also showcase Mission LiFE - Lifestyle for Environment - as a theme of India’s pavilion here at Sharm El- Sheikh during the conference which will conclude on November 18. The move will bring into focus the unsustainable lifestyle of rich nations whose excessive consumption of resources is considered one of the key factors behind high cumulative historical emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) that is responsible for climate change-induced extreme weather events affecting poor and developing countries the most.India is also expected to raise the issue of climate finance in a big way at the Conference. The UNEP report recently noted that the developing countries will need as much as $340 billion a year by 2030 for taking multiple adaptation measures to minimise the impact of climate change, but the international finance flows from developed nations for this purpose currently stands at less than one-tenth of that amount."Estimated annual adaptation needs are $160-340 billion by 2030 and $315-565 billion by 2050,” said the UNEP’s ‘Adaptation Gap’ report while flagging that the international adaptation finance flows, from developed to developing countries, however, reached only $29 billion in 2020.Besides the issue of climate finance, the climate conference will also see the first meaningful discussion on the issue of ‘loss and damage’ to work on a mechanism to provide assistance to developing countries for averting and minimising the impacts of climate change.The ‘Adaptation Gap’ report finds that the combined adaptation and mitigation finance flows in 2020 fell at least $17 billion short of the $100 billion pledged by rich nations (historical polluters) to developing countries. “Significant acceleration is needed if a doubling of 2019 finance flows by 2025 is to be met, as urged by the Glasgow Climate Pact,” it said.Another UNEP report on ‘Emission Gap’found that the collective climate actions - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) - of countries under the Paris Agreement could lead the global warming of 2.4-2.6 degree Celsius by the end of the century against the desirable goal of keeping the warming within 1.5 degree Celsius.Underlining the concerns, it noted that the policies currently in place, without further strengthening, suggest a 2.8 degree C of global warming by the end of the century - a scenario which would be more hazardous in terms of extreme weather events and related crises across the globe.“Such trends mean that adaptation must take centre stage alongside mitigation in the global response to climate change,” said the UN body. It noted that since even ambitious investments in adaptation cannot fully prevent climate impacts, losses and damages must also be addressed.

Article Heading: U. S. to Pay Millions to Move Tribes Threatened by Climate Change
Article Text:
WASHINGTON — The Biden administration will give three Native tribes $75 million to move away from coastal areas or rivers, one of the nation’s largest efforts to date to relocate communities that are facing an urgent threat from climate change.

The three communities — two in Alaska, and one in Washington State — will each get $25 million to move their key buildings onto higher ground and away from rising waters, with the expectation that homes will follow. The federal government will give eight more tribes $5 million each to plan for relocation.

“It gave me goose bumps when I found out we got that money,” said Joseph John Jr., a council member in Newtok, a village in southwest Alaska where the land is quickly eroding. It will receive $25 million to relocate inland. “It will mean a lot to us.”

Article Heading: Congress Offers $1 Billion for Climate Aid, Falling Short of Biden’s Pledge
Article Text:
A spokesman for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, did not respond to a request for comment.

Saloni Sharma, a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council, said in a statement that meeting Mr. Biden’s $11.4 billion goal was a top priority. “Over the past several weeks and throughout the past weekend, members of the administration worked to secure funding in FY23 that puts us on a path to achieving this goal,” she said. “We will continue to work with Congress to make achieving this goal in FY24 a reality.”

Helping other nations adapt to and mitigate damages caused by a warming planet has always been a tough sell in Congress. President Barack Obama promised $3 billion to the Green Climate Fund, but only delivered $1 billion of that money. President Donald J. Trump called the fund a “scheme to redistribute wealth out of the United States” and zeroed out money for it, as well as the bulk of other global climate finance.

The $1 billion in international climate money in the spending bill would be spread over several programs including the Climate Investment Funds, which are housed at the World Bank and are aimed at helping countries develop clean energy; the Global Environment Facility, a multilateral fund that focuses on biodiversity and tends to win Republican support; and smaller programs directed at assisting the world’s poorest nations. The money marked a .09 percent increase from Congress’ allocation in 2021.

Meanwhile, the Biden administration has raised the stakes. At the United Nations climate summit in Egypt the United States agreed to the creation of an entirely new fund aimed at helping poor countries that are experiencing irreversible losses from climate change. The United States and other industrialized countries did not commit to a specific level of funding.

In an interview this month, John Kerry, Mr. Biden’s special climate envoy, said that the United States has a history of bipartisan support for what he called “humanitarian efforts.”

Christina DeConcini, director of government affairs at the World Resources Institute, agreed, pointing to rare areas of agreement like bipartisan support to help Haiti after the 2010 earthquake. Getting congressional backing for international climate issues was a matter of educating lawmakers, she said.
